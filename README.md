# AI-Stock-Predictor-Web-App 

AI-powered web application for stock-market prediction: the app ingests historical stock data, applies machine learning prediction models, and displays predicted future prices in an interactive graph accessible via a web-interface.

 **Disclaimer:** This app is a research / educational tool. Use predictions for learning or experimentation only — **do not treat them as financial advice**. Always consult a qualified financial advisor before making real investments.

## Quick Demo / Live Version

You can try the live version at:  
[ai-stock-predictor-web-app.vercel.app](https://ai-stock-predictor-web-app.vercel.app)  

*(If the hosted version is down or deprecated, it's also easy to spin up locally — see Installation below.)*

## Features

- Fetches historical stock price data  
- Applies a trained ML model to predict future stock prices  
- Plots past data and future prediction on an interactive graph (frontend)  
- Simple, clean UI built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Backend powered by Python + Flask + scientific libraries

## Installation (Local Setup)

Use these steps to run the app on your local machine.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rithvik-palepu/AI-Stock-Predictor-Web-App.git
cd AI-Stock-Predictor-Web-App

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. (Optional) Download or prepare any required model/data files
#    e.g. if there is a pre-trained model file, ensure it's in the expected path.

# 5. Run the Flask backend server
cd backend
export FLASK_APP=app.py      # or your main backend file name
flask run                     # or `python app.py`

# 6. Open the frontend
#    In your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or whichever port shown)
Depending on your setup and whether you use system python3 / pip3, you might need to adjust commands accordingly.
Usage
Open the web app (local or deployed).
Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL, GOOGL, etc.).
Optionally set parameters (e.g. prediction horizon, date range).
Hit "Predict" → the backend fetches historical data, runs the model, and returns a plot.
View the plot — past price data + predicted future trend.
